# Chip-Firing

This is all of the code that I wrote for Directed Reading Program project on Chip-Firing.
The folder python contains all of the code for some animations that I did as well as other things that I played around with.
The folder Rotor Routing contains the code needed to run my interactive website, with a specific code base found [here](https://github.com/TKing321/rotor-routing),
and a website found [here](https://tking321.github.io/rotor-routing/).
